After moving the imperial capital to Avalonia, Almuria released Akhetutan, Sabata, and Noenna in exchange of the Tridstone.

This energy was genertaed by extracting litle by litle energy from Tridstone using the Aurelionate Device. During a test of the device, a massive energy pulse violently radiated outward and destroyed Almuria, causing it to sink into the sea and trigger the world's disaster.

The Kingdom of Arxia was a monarchy in the Blora Desert on the Southeast Eustasia Peninsula that was founded by Gunnar to protect his people. Beginning as a small tribe, Gunnar founded the kingdom after his encounter with the Zedus Ephor, who foresaw the Arxian would face many trials and tribulations but it would ultimately prosper and become a beacon of hope in the desert. Intrigued by Zedus' words, he asked the Ephor to stay with him and guide him. As the Ephor agreed, he developed a rigorous education and training program called Traon. =

Over time, the kingdom grew in number and strength, and they began to establish settlements and trade routes throughout the desert. However, as Zedus had prophesied, they also faced many enemies. During the leadership of Hierarch Mordus, the kingdom faced the biggest crisis as the surrounding states attacked it together. With his ingenuity, and years of training put in by the Arxians, Arxia not only repelled the attacks but also managed to conquer the surrounding states and become the sole ruler of the Blora Desert, exerting its influence to the surrounding kingdoms outside the desert. =

During Archmaster Gloria's rule, the empire controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the Morlovian subcontinent, with the exception of those in the far south, and conquered the western city of Liqomar.

After conquering local tribes in the Morlovian subcontinent, Gloria founded Morlovia, a large Porta Alchemica for local alchemists. These local alchemist apprentices turned out to be more talented than their mentor, and their discoveries were critical to the empire's conquest of the Jorah Kingdom. One of their biggest discoveries is a genetic mutation that can increase one's power, either physically or magically, many times over. After many years of service, the group of alchemists decided that they would be better off if they had their own territory where they could pursue their research without interference. With Gloria's permission, they are granted a small principality of their own. =

Long after conquering and destroying the Western First Order, the Morlovians set their sights on Machinia to quell their thirst for blood. During that time, the Machinicus already worshiped Machine-God Machina and had mostly modified small parts of their bodies with machines. The Morlovians were initially confident in their abilities but they soon discovered that the Machinians were impervious to the vampire's bites, and their weapons were too powerful for the vampires to withstand.

The Order of Witchers was an attempt made by lonkos (chiefs) and affiliated mages on the Sumbawa Continent to create a magical order using warriors who will help them get rid of enemies they previously could not subdue, attach to reservations, or exterminate – monsters. The final outcome of the mutations disappointed most of the mages, who began referring to the result as 'witchers', charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery. The Order didn't last long however – its members had abandoned most of the original 'warrior' values over time and soon split into a handful of witcher schools, aimed at taking a more professional approach to eradicating monsters. =

The original idea for the formation of the Order coined after the fall of Morlovia, which caused many vampires to flee to the north and northwest. Argos, Praetor of Machinia, didn't bother with the runaway vampires and chose to conquer Morlovia's territory, and reclaim the area that used to belong to the Jorah Kingdom. Facing the terror of the remnants of vampires, and monsters lurking in the dark, the Order of Witchers was established under the leadership of Mage Cosimo Malaspina. =

After the earliest attempts at creating witchers with adults proved unsatisfactory, it was decided that children would be used for future experiments. They were trained by professionals from all over the continents in their respective skills: the huntsmen taught them to track and hunt, the alchemists on how to brew potions and concoctions, and the swordsmen on how to fight. Despite all this, the children proved unsatisfactory and disappointed most of the mages, who began to call the result 'witchers', charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery.

Giants are a non-human race considered to be a legend by the inhabitants outside of Balvaria. However, giants do actually exist in Nusa Islands, and never interact with the outside world. The first civilization the giants interacted with was Dwargon, when a group of giants called Förstarna, or the First Giants, crossed the Vänern Sea and settled on the Horn of Balvaria, with whom they periodically clashed. The Second Giants, Andarna, came during the Dissolution of Berenger. The giants, under the leadership of Magnar, formed a mercenary group of giants because of their power and the difficulty of finding plentiful food. Erhab, meaning terrors, is the name given by the Dwarni to the giants because of their terrifying presence. =
