'Nkuhanea is the earliest known civilization in the historical region of Aaru on the southern Pangaea, emerging during the Karamithic, the time before the Gods left Earth. It is one of the cradles of civilization in the world, along with ancient Lemuria, Shangri-La, Polgar Sod'em, Artiza, Chorislavia, and ancient Eldariya. Living along the valleys of the Madris and Timika rivers, Nkuhanean farmers grew an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus from which enabled them to form urban settlements. =

During Queen Erish's reign, the miners of Nkuhanea discovered an unknown stone, which became known as the Tridstone. The Tridstone shone of its own inner light, and appeared a little globe of pallid light in darkness. This stone was sent to Polgar Sod'em to be made into a necklace for Queen Erish. It is a stone that is dangerous yet useful for the chosen ones because it can affect the user's soul. Queen Erish, almost every time she sleeps, dreams of strange signs. Some of these signs help her bring prosperity to the kingdom after being interpreted. =

Polgar Sod'em is a historical kingdom in the southern continent of Pangaea.

After Queen Erish found the Tridstone, she requested King Hajruddin to make her a necklace from the stone. Knowing this, Dathun sent his envoy to persuade Hajruddin to conspire and exchange the Tridstone for another stone. Hajruddin rejected the greed shown by the envoy.

As the dominant power of the eastern part of central Pangea, Eldariya inevitably came into conflict with many neighbors and rivals, from the indigenous Chorislaviani of Central Pangea to the nascent Almuria. Following the conflict and annexation of Nubkhecris, its growing competition with Almuria culminated in the Mudariya Wars, which saw some of the largest battles in history. Eldariya narrowly avoided destruction after the Third Mudariya War, and was destroyed by the Almurians after the fourth and final Mudariya War. All remnants of the Eldars civilization came under Almuria rule, and Almuria subsequently became the dominant power, paving the way for its rise as a major empire. Almuria, howerver, decided not to mess with the Crypt of the Unliving because of the Tomb Guard, an entity they had never seen before. =

Almuria was an empire that controlled Manas Island, Shangri-La, and parts of Pangea, from Kumari Kandam to Mamuju, excluding Akhetutan, Sabata, and Noenna. It was founded on Manas Island in the town of Lemuria by the Almurian tribal leader Ishana. After five years of establishment, Almuria crossed into Pangea and, with the conquest of Erum and the annexation of Shangri-La along the way, Almuria was transformed into an empire.

Under the reign of Fala Vieya, Almuria marked the peak of its power and prosperity. After moving the imperial capital to Avalonia, Almuria released Akhetutan, Sabata, and Noenna in exchange of the Tridstone. In collaboration with the Sodites, Almuria developed a series of new technologies centered upon the discovery of an inexhaustible source of energy. This energy was genertaed by extracting litle by litle energy from Tridstone using the Aurelionate Device. During a test of the device, a massive energy pulse violently radiated outward and destroyed Almuria, causing it to sink into the sea and trigger the world's disaster. The energy pulse affected the survivors biologically, causing them to gain the ability to breathe underwater and the superhuman strength needed to survive in the deep ocean. =

Thallin, also referred to as Thwallin, or Tailin, was a Taloon-speaking state and cultural area based in the city of Thwallin in central-northern Llotidea. It played an important role in establishing the first empire in Llotidea after the Doom of the Old World. Thallin was often involved in rivalry with the state of Dayne to the east and Dwarven kingdom of Manthrill to the north. Thallin became the major power in the region after Sengai created a short-lived empire, succeeding Grokzut and Glaceholm. = 
 # Requires translation!
Sengai made a rule that prisoners of war from areas conquered by Thallin did not have the freedom right and were killed and used as slaves. This made many of the Glaceholmian secretly flee to the Crawl of Nortasia with the help of Crotoa. When Torakj attacked and ravaged the kingdom, Jag'ar and his fellow beastmen revolted and slaughter the Tailin nobles and their supporter. Thallin's remaining residents then fled southeast and founded the Smeheng kingdom along the Karionam River. =

It is considered one of the most terrifying principalities, later becoming a kingdom and then an empire, in the history of mankind. The principality reached its height under the rule of Vlad Ţepeş, who unilaterally took control of the principality after going became a Dracula. During its peak, the principality conquered and destroyed the Western First Order and caused terror and chaos, which became the main cause of the division of the military commanders in the Eastern First Order. =

After conquering local tribes in the Morlovian subcontinent, Gloria founded Morlovia, a large Porta Alchemica for local alchemists. These local alchemist apprentices turned out to be more talented than their mentor, and their discoveries were critical to the empire's conquest of the Jorah Kingdom. One of their biggest discoveries is a genetic mutation that can increase one's power, either physically or magically, many times over. After many years of service, the group of alchemists decided that they would be better off if they had their own territory where they could pursue their research without interference. With Gloria's permission, they are granted a small principality of their own. =

Long after conquering and destroying the Western First Order, the Morlovians set their sights on Machinia to quell their thirst for blood. During that time, the Machinicus already worshiped Machine-God Machina and had mostly modified small parts of their bodies with machines. The Morlovians were initially confident in their abilities but they soon discovered that the Machinians were impervious to the vampire's bites, and their weapons were too powerful for the vampires to withstand.

The Order of Witchers was an attempt made by lonkos (chiefs) and affiliated mages on the Sumbawa Continent to create a magical order using warriors who will help them get rid of enemies they previously could not subdue, attach to reservations, or exterminate – monsters. The final outcome of the mutations disappointed most of the mages, who began referring to the result as 'witchers', charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery. The Order didn't last long however – its members had abandoned most of the original 'warrior' values over time and soon split into a handful of witcher schools, aimed at taking a more professional approach to eradicating monsters. =

The Order of Witchers was an attempt made by lonkos (chiefs) and affiliated mages on the Sumbawa Continent to create a magical order using warriors who will help them get rid of enemies they previously could not subdue, attach to reservations, or exterminate – monsters. The original idea for the formation of the Order coined after the fall of Morlovia, which caused many vampires to flee to the north and northwest. Argos, Praetor of Machinia, didn't bother with the runaway vampires and chose to conquer Morlovia's territory, and reclaim the area that used to belong to the Jorah Kingdom. Facing the terror of the remnants of vampires, and monsters lurking in the dark, the Order of Witchers was established under the leadership of Mage Cosimo Malaspina. = 
 # Requires translation!
After the earliest attempts at creating witchers with adults proved unsatisfactory, it was decided that children would be used for future experiments. They were trained by professionals from all over the continents in their respective skills: the huntsmen taught them to track and hunt, the alchemists on how to brew potions and concoctions, and the swordsmen on how to fight. Despite all this, the children proved unsatisfactory and disappointed most of the mages, who began to call the result 'witchers', charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery. The mutations had opened their bodies to the flow of power, but they ended up with limited magical talent. =

Several Dualis rulers, including the Antium kings Giovanni and Luca the Leaky Eye, further donated lands to be governed by the Holy Ecclessiarch. During the reign of Mattimeo, the ecclesiarchy launched an attack on Gomorra and positioned Gomorra as an external threat to the faith.

As the crusades unfolded, the ecclesiarchy's power continued to grow. Mattimeo took advantage of this opportunity to launch further crusades into Umbria and Romagna. The faith's dominance over the continent was solidified, and the Holy Ecclesiarch became the supreme authority in religious matters, effectively eclipsing the influence of secular rulers. At its zenith, the ecclessiatch not only spread its influence to the human race, Sanctum Regalia also managed to tie up cooperation with the stopover country of Vedic and convert some of its government members to Dualism. =

During the reign of Galamar II, the kingdom expanded its territory to the borders of the Rain Forest and Berenger Kingdom in the south and The Kingdom of Malus in the southwest. Because he controlled a very large area in the north, Galamar II and his successors were given the honorary title of The King in the North. After the death of Galamar V at the Battle of Malus, Valadorn took over leadership of the kingdom, forcing Galamar VI into exile in Berenger Kingdom, and went into hiding in the Dukedom of Nas. = 
 # Requires translation!
During his reign, Valadorn succeeded in conquering Malus in the continuation of the War of Malus. Malus, however, managed to re-assert sovereignty after Thorin was invaded by the Urg and Rog simultaneously from the north and northeast, which marked the beginning of the Great War of Balvaria. Attacked from three sides, including a mutiny by the remnants of Malus' army, the Kingdom of Thorin collapsed. Valadorn and his subjects was slaughtered by Saeth, leaving Galamar VI as sole successor to the Rasmey dynasty. =

The Kingdom of Malus is a state in south-central Balvaria and is bordered by the Berenger Kingdom in the southeast and the Thorin Empire in the northeast. It was established after the death of the 3rd Karaeng (King) of Shaquad, Rouben. Rouben's successor as the 4th Karaeng of Shaquad was his eldest son Temuraz, while his younger brother Artyom crossed the Lake Tandano and established the Kingdom of Malus. After the ascension of Barret, envoys of the Thorin Empire delivered an ultimatum to Barret. Under the Thorans terms, Malus would have been required to disband his army and accept Thorin's sovereignty. Barret refused, and the war between Malus and Thorin began. = 
 # Requires translation!
The War of Malus started with a battle on the Pariaman-Sudd Garden border. Despite an early victory for the Thorans at the Sudd Garden Conflict, Malusian fought back and won the Battle at Laiden Hill, the Battle of Pariaman, and the Battle of Tlulao, where Galamar V was killed by Barrett in an unexpected swift attack in the early hours of the morning. After becoming emperor of Thorin, Valadorn attacked Malus again. With better strategy and logistics, the Thorans decisively defeated the Malusian army. In the end Malus managed to re-assert sovereignty and even expanded the kingdom's territory to the Stoughry River. =

After remaining hidden for uncounted years, Saeth led an army of undead and ogres of Rog to conquer the Thorin Empire, killing its leader in a fierce battle. Saeth then set his sights on the southern reaches of Rain Forest, home of the Niranna elves. He led his army against the elven warriors, but they were ill-prepared for the dark magic that Saeth wielded. But Saeth's victory was short-lived, as the Dryads of the Rain Forest, powerful beings of nature magic, rose up against him.

When Saeth conquered Thorin, Nualla realized that the Niranni needed to form an alliance with other kingdoms to protect themselves and their home. She reached out to the Berenger Kingdom, Canthyria, Clockwek, and Nevdes hoping to create a multi-race alliance against Saeth. However, her efforts were in vain, as the Berenger Kingdom chose to side with Urg and revealed their secret plan to Saeth. Saeth, now armed with this knowledge, easily conquers Niranna and Canthyria. The situation changed when the Dryads of the Rain Forest rose up against Saeth, summoning the power of the forest to defeat his army and drive him back.

Giants are a non-human race considered to be a legend by the inhabitants outside of Balvaria. However, giants do actually exist in Nusa Islands, and never interact with the outside world. The first civilization the giants interacted with was Dwargon, when a group of giants called Förstarna, or the First Giants, crossed the Vänern Sea and settled on the Horn of Balvaria, with whom they periodically clashed. The Second Giants, Andarna, came during the Dissolution of Berenger. The giants, under the leadership of Magnar, formed a mercenary group of giants because of their power and the difficulty of finding plentiful food. Erhab, meaning terrors, is the name given by the Dwarni to the giants because of their terrifying presence. =

During the Battle of Kar Doral, the Dwargons endured Erhab's full attack with their mecha golems. The mecha machines proved to be a formidable weapon, but the giants were relentless. The Dwarni dwarves were pushed back, and their kingdom was in danger of falling. In a last ditch effort to save his people, Higba, King of Dwargon, unleashed the ultimate weapon – Orichalchum Golem. This powerful mecha was the result of years of hard work and dedication by Higba and his personal team of engineers. Even though it's still in development, the mecha golem helps Dwargon won the battle but the victory came at a great cost., Higba's life. Almira, one of his team of engineers, became the Queen of Dwargon and created the Heart of Perpetuity. She signed the 500 Years Peace Treaty with the giants and ordered the completion of the Orichalcum Golem to anticipate any new threats that may come. =

Shortly after Bulvan's defeat, Zorgorath speeds up his plan and sends the giants of Erhab to attack Dwargon, and sends the trolls to attack Nevdes. In the swift attack, Nevdes was defeated, as most of Nevdes' troops joined the Aeyris Alliances in the war against Bulvan. Zorgorath ordered Ttarmek to open the Endless Door in one of the dungeons of Nevdes, one of which is connected to the Slumbering Gate, so that Zorgorath could send more troops there. Opposing the chances of Zorgorath ruling the world, Barret, king of Malus, declared war against the trolls and marched to the southeast to cancel the operation. Despite the Malusian efforts, Ttarmek and his army of trolls managed to defend the conquered city. =

Wary that his arrival would be disturbed by the Aeyris Alliances, while he needed preparation to summon his army, Zorgorath devised a plan to stall time.

Red Moon is an organization that takes in and protects witches from across the Balvaria. The organization was originally formed by a few witches, including Veronika, in the Sea Wind Region who wished to protect themselves from persecution. They made their shelter in a forest and avoided contact with the outside world. After their shelter being attacked, Veronika decided to use the information in a book she called the Holy Book, to lead her sisters to the Sabbath, a place rumored to be where witches can go through their Day of Awakening with no pain and live peacefully. =

Despite their efforts, the witches couldn't locate the Sabbath. Along the way, they encounter Claudia, who has the ability to read the hidden messages contained in the book.

However, the project needs a magical stone called the Tridstone, which was lost during the Doom of the Old World. Losing their hopes, Claudia then established a settlement in Blasicken for the witches. Later, she was approached by Queen Nualla to join the Aeyris Alliances and fight against Zorgorath. =

The Frostmorrowi dominance in the region culminated during the reign of Tormund Drake, who invaded the Odeila Kingdom in order to avenge the dead of his adopted son by King Atley. With the annexation of Odeila, the Kingdom of Frostmorrow reached its largest territorial extent.
